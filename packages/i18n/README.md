# @pracht/i18n

First-party i18n primitives for [Pracht](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht),
productizing the framework's documented pattern: **middleware detects the
locale → loaders return translations → components consume them via route
data**. This is deliberately not a translation framework — it is the typed
plumbing around locale detection, lazy dictionaries, plural selection, and
hreflang metadata. The package is UI-library free: it works with the Preact
renderer and with Fels / `@pracht/solid`.

```bash
npm install @pracht/i18n
```

## Quick start

```ts
// src/i18n/index.ts — one instance per app
import { createDictionaries, defineI18n } from "@pracht/i18n";

export const i18n = defineI18n({
  locales: ["en", "nl"],
  defaultLocale: "en",
});

export const dictionaries = createDictionaries(
  {
    en: () => import("./locales/en.ts"),
    nl: () => import("./locales/nl.ts"),
  },
  { defaultLocale: "en" },
);
```

```ts
// src/middleware/i18n.ts — the manifest expects a `middleware` export
import { i18n } from "../i18n/index.ts";

export const middleware = i18n.middleware;
```

```ts
// src/routes.ts — one pathPrefix group per locale; only registered locales
// ever match, so /zz/shop 404s instead of serving duplicate content
group({ middleware: ["i18n"] }, [
  route("/welcome", () => import("./routes/welcome-redirect.tsx"), { render: "ssr" }),
  group({ pathPrefix: "/en" }, [route("/welcome", () => import("./routes/welcome.tsx"), { render: "ssr" })]),
  group({ pathPrefix: "/nl" }, [route("/welcome", () => import("./routes/welcome.tsx"), { render: "ssr" })]),
]),
```

> [URL strategies](#url-strategies) if your URLs cannot change.

```tsx
// src/routes/welcome.tsx
import type { HeadArgs, LoaderArgs, RouteComponentProps } from "@pracht/core";
import { t, type I18nRequestContext } from "@pracht/i18n";
import { useEffect } from "preact/hooks";

import { dictionaries, i18n } from "../i18n/index.ts";

export async function loader({ context }: LoaderArgs<I18nRequestContext<"en" | "nl">>) {
  const messages = await dictionaries.load(context.locale);
  return { locale: context.locale, messages };
}

export function head({ data, url }: HeadArgs<typeof loader>) {
  return {
    lang: data.locale,
    title: t(data.messages, "welcome.title"),
    link: i18n.hreflang(url.pathname, { origin: "https://example.com" }),
  };
}

export function Component({ data }: RouteComponentProps<typeof loader>) {
  // Required on SSG/ISG pages: their stored response cannot set a
  // visitor-specific cookie. It is harmless when middleware already did so.
  useEffect(() => {
    i18n.setLocaleCookie(data.locale);
  }, [data.locale]);
  return <h1>{t(data.messages, "welcome.title", { name: "Jovi" })}</h1>;
}
```

A complete, tested setup lives in
[`examples/basic`](../../examples/basic) — locale-prefixed (`/welcome`,
`/en/welcome`, `/nl/welcome`) and prefix-free (`/greeting`) against one
instance — and the full guide is the
[i18n recipe](https://pracht.resynapse.dev/docs/recipes/i18n).

## URL strategies

Detection, dictionaries, and `t()` are identical either way; the only
question is whether the locale is part of the URL.

**A. Locale-prefixed URLs** (`/en/about`) — one `pathPrefix` group per
locale, switching means navigating, `hreflang()` gives every language its
own indexable URL, and routes can be `ssg`/`isg`. The better default for
public content. Path-resolved SSR/SPA responses vary on `Cookie` because
whether they emit the persistence cookie depends on the incoming cookie;
SSG/ISG output needs only the URL cache key and persists the explicit prefix
after hydration with `setLocaleCookie()`.

**B. One URL per page** (`/about`) — nothing about your routes changes. The
cookie decides, `Accept-Language` seeds the first visit, and the middleware
adds `Vary: Cookie, Accept-Language` (so these routes stay per-request:
`ssr` or `spa`, never `ssg`/`isg`). Adopting it changes no URLs, and
switching needs no navigation:

```ts
// src/api/locale.ts — switch that works without JavaScript
export async function POST({ request, url }: BaseRouteArgs) {
  const form = await request.formData();
  const locale = form.get("locale");
  if (!i18n.isLocale(locale)) return new Response("Unknown locale", { status: 400 });
  const response = redirect("/", { request, status: 303 });
  response.headers.append("set-cookie", i18n.localeCookie(locale, { url }));
  return response;
}
```

```ts
// …or entirely on the client: no request, same URL
const messages = await dictionaries.load("nl"); // lazily imported chunk
i18n.setLocaleCookie("nl"); // remember only a successfully loaded locale
setMessages(messages);
```

When several locale choices can be made before their lazy chunks finish,
guard the async work so only the latest successful selection updates both the
cookie and component state. Synchronously invalidate pending work when a
server-backed switch or navigation starts, then use a layout-effect cleanup
when loader data changes or the component unmounts. The first guard closes the
window before a new loader result commits; the cleanup prevents stale work
during the commit itself. Because `head()` ran on the server, an in-place
switch must also update `document.documentElement.lang` and the localized
`document.title`; the full recipe below shows that pattern.

The trade-off is SEO: a single URL cannot carry `hreflang` alternates, so
crawlers index whichever locale their `Accept-Language` resolves to. The
detection order is the same for both (`["path", "cookie", "header"]`), so
one app can mix them — the path source simply never matches a prefix-free
route.

## `defineI18n({ locales, defaultLocale, detect?, cookie? })`

Creates the app's i18n instance:

- **`middleware`** — resolves the locale (default order: URL prefix →
  cookie → `Accept-Language` q-values), sets `context.locale`, and persists
  an explicit URL-prefix choice in the locale cookie (`Path=/`,
  `SameSite=Lax`, one year, `Secure` on https). Persistence is skipped on
  prerenderable (SSG/ISG) routes — their output is stored and replayed to
  every visitor, so it must never carry `Set-Cookie` — and header-derived
  locales are never persisted. The middleware also appends
  `Vary: Cookie` / `Accept-Language` when those sources were consulted. A
  path-resolved SSR/SPA response also varies on `Cookie`, because the presence
  of its persistence `Set-Cookie` depends on the incoming cookie; path-only
  SSG/ISG output does not. Note: a **thrown** `Response`
  (`throw redirect(...)`) short-circuits past the middleware chain and gets
  neither the cookie nor `Vary` — `return` redirects from loaders on
  localized routes instead. SSG/ISG requests cannot persist a visitor-specific
  cookie in stored output; call `setLocaleCookie(data.locale)` in a hydrated
  localized component so later unprefixed detector routes remember the choice.
- **`localePath(path, locale)`** — prefix/replace the locale in a path,
  preserving query and hash. It resolves literal/encoded dot segments before
  prefixing, so browser URL normalization cannot escape the locale namespace.
  Throws for unregistered locales, so user input can never be reflected into
  a URL.
- **`splitLocale(path)`** / **`isLocale(value)`** / **`detect(request)`** —
  the underlying primitives. `splitLocale()` always returns a root-relative
  pathname, including when URL normalization exposes duplicate slashes after
  the locale prefix.
- **`localeCookie(locale, { url?, secure? })`** — serialize the locale
  cookie (`null` clears it) for prefix-free switches: the middleware never
  sees an explicit choice when the URL does not carry one, so the switch
  writes it. `url` infers `Secure` exactly like the middleware;
  `SameSite=None` always forces `Secure`, including when an explicit option
  says otherwise, because browsers reject the cookie without it.
- **`setLocaleCookie(locale)`** / **`detectClient()`** — the browser
  counterparts: write the cookie through `document.cookie`, and resolve the
  locale from `location.pathname` / `document.cookie` /
  `navigator.languages` in the configured order (returns the default locale
  when called during SSR).
- **`hreflang(path, { origin?, xDefault? })`** — `link[]` alternate entries
  for `head()`: one per locale plus `x-default` (the unprefixed detector
  route by default), preserving the path's query/hash suffix on every target.

Only registered locales can ever win detection: URL prefixes, cookie values,
and `Accept-Language` tags are validated against the registry, malformed or
duplicate q-values (`;q=`, `;q=abc`, repeated `;q=`) are dropped rather than
promoted, and oversized headers are bounded without parsing the final entry
when the length limit cuts it in half. A q-value must be a complete decimal
token, so a numeric prefix such as `q=0.5junk` is rejected too.
Wildcards can only resolve to a registered locale and never revive a locale
explicitly rejected with `q=0`; neither lookup truncation nor best-fit fallback
can bypass that rejection.
Header matching follows RFC 4647 lookup — direct range matches (registered
`en-GB-oxendict` for requested `en-GB`) and progressive truncation
(`zh-Hant-TW` → `zh-Hant` → `zh`) — plus a script-compatible same-language
best fit (`en-GB` matches a registered `en-US`, while `zh-Hans` does not
best-fit `zh-Hant`) before falling through to lower-preference entries. Every
locale accepted by `defineI18n()` remains detectable even when its full tag is
longer than a common language-region pair.

Note that route matching is exact: `pathPrefix: "/nl"` serves `/nl/...`,
not `/NL/...`. Keep locale prefixes lowercase in links (use `localePath`).

## Dictionaries

Flat string keys, one module per locale, default export:

```ts
// src/i18n/locales/en.ts
export default {
  "home.title": "Welcome, {name}",
  "notes.count.one": "{count} note",
  "notes.count.other": "{count} notes",
} as const;
```

- `dictionaries.load(locale)` lazily imports the locale (cached), merged
  over the default locale so every key resolves. The result is a plain
  serializable object (plus a reserved `$locale` key) — return it from a
  loader and use the same `t()` on the client.
- `$`-prefixed keys are reserved and omitted from both the loaded object and
  its translation-key type. Other own flat keys, including `__proto__`, are
  preserved without consulting or mutating an object prototype.
- `t(messages, key, params?)` — typed keys derived from the default
  locale's shape; `{param}` interpolation is single-pass (values containing
  braces are never re-interpolated) and reads own properties only. Unknown
  dynamic keys return the key itself.
- `tPlural(messages, key, count, params?)` — selects `<key>.<category>` via
  `Intl.PluralRules` for the dictionary's locale (declare `.few`/`.many`
  for locales like Polish), falling back to `<key>.other`. `{count}` is
  always available as a param.

## Typing `context.locale`

The middleware writes `context.locale`. Register it once via the framework's
`Register` pattern:

```ts
// src/env.d.ts
import type { I18nRequestContext } from "@pracht/i18n";

declare module "@pracht/core" {
  interface Register {
    context: I18nRequestContext<"en" | "nl">;
  }
}
```

(Intersect with your adapter context if you already register one.)
