/**
 * Pracht's client chunking policy, expressed as something an app can build on.
 *
 * The framework has exactly one opinion here: Preact belongs in its own chunk,
 * shared by every route and cached across deploys that only change app code.
 * Everything else about chunking is the app's call — merging the long tail of
 * small initial chunks, splitting a heavy dependency out of a route, grouping
 * by feature.
 *
 * Those two have to coexist, and under Rolldown that is not automatic:
 * `output.codeSplitting` makes `manualChunks` and `advancedChunks` ignored
 * outright, so a plugin that hard-codes one form silently deletes whichever
 * form the app used. Pracht therefore looks at what the app configured and
 * contributes its group in the same form, as one entry appended to the app's
 * list rather than as a replacement for it.
 *
 * Precedence follows Rolldown's own rule — higher `priority` first, then
 * declaration order. The app's groups are declared first, so an app group that
 * would also capture Preact wins at equal priority, and pracht's group only
 * takes what nothing else claimed. To keep the framework chunk intact while
 * merging everything around it, give the app group a `test` that excludes
 * Preact, or raise pracht's group by placing {@link frameworkChunkGroups}
 * explicitly and setting `vendorChunk: false`.
 */

/**
 * Modules that make up the framework runtime's vendor chunk.
 *
 * `[\\/]` rather than `/` so the group matches on Windows, and no trailing
 * boundary so the Preact family — `preact/hooks`, `preact-suspense`,
 * `preact-render-to-string` — lands in one chunk with Preact itself.
 *
 * When a non-Preact renderer is active, call {@link setFrameworkVendorTest}
 * with that renderer's `vendorChunkTest` so the vendor chunk still groups
 * correctly.
